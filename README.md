# Deep Learning with Caffe
Deep learning with Caffe introduces you to Machine Learning and Caffe frameworks, such as layers, nets, and blobs. You'll learn the basic concepts of NLP, what it is intended for, and bring this concepts into the Caffe-NLP fork later on. You will dive deeper into NLP under Caffe-NLP, train models using the world’s most famous benchmark, and also create your own models. You'll explore LSTM, CNN, and RNN - the practical real-world topics - that will introduce you to all the potential for deep learning and Caffe. You'll also be provided an introduction to basic Caffe’s functions and concepts to work with computer vision and C++.


## What you will learn
* Utilize machine learning core concepts
* Apply Convolutional Neural Nets concepts to real-life scenarios
* Use Recurrent Neural Nets concepts in real-life scenarios 
* Understand ideas behind model training to train data
* Create and apply your own models to real-world scenarios 
* Apply the core concepts of NLP using Caffe for sentiment analysis
* Use Caffe’s C++ architecture for object detection
